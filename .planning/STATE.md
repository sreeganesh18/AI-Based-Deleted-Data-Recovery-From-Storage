# STATE: AI Deleted Data Recovery

## Current Milestone: Integrated Carving & Denoising
Phase 3 has been successfully completed, including training infrastructure updates, hybrid carver integration, and denoising pipeline implementation.

## Completed Phases
- [x] **Phase 1: Foundation & Data Management**
  - [x] Project environment initialization.
  - [x] Dataset management structure.
  - [x] Basic storage scanner and signature carver.
- [x] **Phase 2: Core AI Models**
  - [x] Fragment Classifier architecture (1D-CNN).
  - [x] Denoising Autoencoder architecture.
  - [x] Training and preprocessing utilities.
- [x] **Phase 3: File Carving & Denoising**
  - [x] 03-01: Training infrastructure with 80/20 val split and PSNR/SSIM.
  - [x] 03-02: HybridCarver (Signatures + AI) and DenoisingPipeline.
  - [x] 03-03: Integrated Pipeline Validation & Reporting.

- [x] **Phase 4: Reconstruction & Enhancement**
  - [x] 04-01: Fragment Grouping & Parallel Reconstruction (Mixed Approach, 1MB radius).
  - [x] 04-02: Structural Repair for JPEG and PDF (XREF/Header Synthesis).
  - [x] 04-03: Advanced AI Super-Resolution & E2E Validation.

## Next Phase: Phase 5 - User Interface & Finalization
- [ ] Develop Streamlit-based UI for recovery management.
- [ ] Implement visual comparison dashboard for denoised/enhanced results.
- [ ] Finalize E2E integration and API documentation.
- [ ] Packaging and project cleanup.

## Current Focus
- Transitioning to Phase 5: User Interface & Finalization.
